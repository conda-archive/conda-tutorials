# Windows

## Constructor File

Windows requires additional packages from msys2, note that this channel is added for the Windows installer.
```
channels:
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2/
```

The constructor file specifies a number of keys:

```
install_in_dependency_order: True 
installer_filename: conda-R.sh 
initialize_by_default: True 
installer_type: exe  [win] 
license_file: ../EULA.txt
```
Note that the conda environment is initialized in install, this means that installing it will overwrite the conda initialization script if Anconda or Miniconda are installed.
